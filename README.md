# Catalift Developer Task

Welcome to the official task repository for candidates applying to join the Catalift development team.

## 🎯 Task Objective

Your task is to **replicate a mobile app screen** based on the design files we’ve shared with you via email. This will help us assess your development skills, code structure, and UI implementation capabilities.
