# Catalift Developer Task

Welcome to the official task repository for candidates applying to join the Catalift development team.

## 🎯 Task Objective

Your task is to **replicate a mobile app screen** based on the design files we’ve shared with you via email. This will help us assess your development skills, code structure, and UI implementation capabilities.

All required design assets (PNG/SVG) have been sent to your registered email address. Please check your inbox for a mail from **techcatalift@gmail.com** with the subject line:

4. Maintain a clean and modular code structure.
